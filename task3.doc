What is the difference between window, screen, and document in JavaScript?

i) Window :-

The window object represents an open window in a browser.It  is a main JavaScript object root, 
aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.

If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.

ii) The Window Screen Object :-

The Screen interface represents a screen, usually the one on which the current window is being rendered, and is obtained using window.screen.

Note that browsers determine which screen to report as current by detecting which screen has the center of the browser window.


iii) document :-

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

The DOM tree includes elements such as <body> and <table>, among many others. 
It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.

The Document interface describes the common properties and methods for any kind of document. 
Depending on the document's type (e.g. HTML, XML, SVG, â€¦), a larger API is available: HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, 
also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.
