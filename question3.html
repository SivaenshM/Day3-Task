    <h4>i) Window :-</h4>

    <br />
    <p>
      The window object represents an open window in a browser.It is a main
      JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can
      also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access
      it as window.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4>ii) The Window Screen Object :-</h4>
    <p>
      The Screen interface represents a screen, usually the one on which the
      current window is being rendered, and is obtained using window.screen.
      Note that browsers determine which screen to report as current by
      detecting which screen has the center of the browser window.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h4>iii) document :-</h4>
    <p>
      The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and
      serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM
      tree. The DOM tree includes elements such as body and table, among many
      others. It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to
      obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document. The
      Document interface describes the common properties and methods for any
      kind of document. Depending on the document's type (e.g. HTML, XML, SVG,
      â€¦), a larger API is available: HTML documents, served with the "text/html"
      content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and
      SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.
